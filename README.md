## 📋 Project description

<p align="justify">
  <br>
  Construction of a basic part of the core of an Operating System developed in C. The basic core contains the minimum structures for the functioning of the processes generated by the user. This includes scheduling these processes, as well as all operations to do so. The libraries used were <b>stdio.h</b> and <b>system.h</b>. The latter was provided by PhD <a href="https://unesp.br/portaldocentes/docentes/229">Antônio Carlos Sementille</a> from São Paulo State University (Unesp) with specific controls for using TIMER and other DOS operating system operations. The project was carried out with the aid of a virtual machine with the DOS operating system.
